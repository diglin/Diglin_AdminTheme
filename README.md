# Diglin_Addinfotoemail #

This Magento module allows to display additional information about one or more products into the sales emails.

## Features

With this module, you can define for each product an additional information that you would like it appears when a customer receive an email after to have create/update a new invoice/order/creditmemo from frontend or backend.

In this email will appear, in place where you decide to put it, a list of products and for each product the additional comment that you wrote about the product.

## Installation

- You must place in the sales emails template (e.g. app/locale/en_US/templates/email/sales/invoice_new.html) the following text: {{layout area="frontend" handle="sales_email_order_products_comments" order=$order}}

### Via Magento Connect

## Documentation

To use it, find in each product edit page, the Additional Options tab and fill the field "Additional comment in Mail". HTML and normal text are accepted. From Magento 1.4 and above, you should have a Wysiwyg editor button.
